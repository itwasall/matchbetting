A way to calculate a weight value, to be multiplied by the ratio of the back odds and lay odds

WHAT WE KNOW

Satisfactory results are given when:
    a) back odds are 10
    b) lay odds are 11.5, or 12.5
    c) weight value is 0.9

Hypothesis:
    Lay bet stake can be calculated by the following:
        ([back odds / lay odds] * weight value ) * back stake

Why I think this:
    The relationship between the back odds and lay odds is cruical to profitability. But it also seems as those their true values can also play a part in this too.
    Also in order to calculate a profitable lay stake we need to know the back stake as to not overlay or underlay.
